# OXOprodle

This is a WebApp project for Sviluppo Applicazioni Web course (Web Application Development).<br>

Prodle is a game inspired by Pokedle and LoLdle.<br>
The main goal of this game is to guess a secret pro.<br>

All pros are represented by features such as country where they live, their age, their jobs, the games they've been working on.<br>
You will be given hints on each of these categories for the pros you guess.<br>

- `green` is an exact match on that same category of the secret pro;<br>
- `yellow` is a partial match (meaning that one value of the two is correct);<br>
- `red` means there's no match at all.<br>

Have fun guessin' 'em all!<br><br><br><br>
